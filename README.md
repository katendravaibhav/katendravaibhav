# Hi, I'm Vaibhav 

I'm an M.Tech Computer Science student at **IIT Delhi** and an SDE-focused developer who enjoys building real systems — from low-level OS and networking projects to full-stack and mobile applications.

Most of my work is around:
- **Systems & Backend:** operating systems, networking, concurrency, APIs
- **Full-stack development:** web apps, distributed components, performance-focused design
- **Mobile apps:** Flutter-based applications with real backend integration

I like working close to how things actually run, whether that's writing kernel code, building protocol logic, or designing end-to-end application pipelines.
