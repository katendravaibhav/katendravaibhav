# Hi, I'm Vaibhav 

I'm an M.Tech Computer Science student at **IIT Delhi** and an SDE-focused developer who enjoys building real systems — from low-level OS and networking projects to full-stack and mobile applications.

Most of my work is around:
- **Systems & Backend:** operating systems, networking, concurrency, APIs
- **Full-stack development:** web apps, distributed components, performance-focused design
- **Mobile apps:** Flutter-based applications with real backend integration

I like working close to how things actually run, whether that's writing kernel code, building protocol logic, or designing end-to-end application pipelines.

##  Tech I work with

**Languages:** C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, Dart  
**Systems:** xv6, Linux, multithreading, scheduling, memory management  
**Backend & Web:** REST APIs, Next.js, TypeScript, microservices basics  
**Networking:** TCP/UDP, SDN (Ryu/Mininet), traffic analysis  
**Mobile:** Flutter, Firebase  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, CI/CD basics, Qt, libcurl

##  Featured Projects

Some projects that represent the kind of work I enjoy:

- **StreamChain** – Decentralized video streaming platform with P2P delivery, blockchain monetization, and client-side AI moderation  
  → IPFS, WebTorrent, Solidity, TensorFlow.js, Next.js

- **Extended xv6 OS** – Kernel-level work including scheduling, signals, secure shell, and adaptive memory swapping  
  → C, xv6, QEMU

- **Mini Web Browser (C++/Qt)** – Custom HTML parser, DOM tree, and multithreaded rendering pipeline  
  → C++, Qt, Flex/Bison, libcurl

- **Advanced Networking Projects** – Reliable UDP, congestion control, and SDN-based routing with performance analysis  
  → C/C++, Python, Ryu, Mininet, Wireshark

- **ShareWheels** – Flutter-based carpooling app with maps and real-time backend  
  → Flutter, Firebase, Google Maps API

Most repos have detailed READMEs explaining design choices and implementation.

##  Competitive Programming & Academics

- **GATE 2024:** AIR 370 (CS), AIR 997 (DA)  
- **LeetCode:** Knight (1905)  
- **Codeforces:** Specialist (1421)

I use CP mainly to stay sharp with problem solving and algorithms, but I care more about applying those ideas in real systems.
